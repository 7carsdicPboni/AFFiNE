Photovcarve Full 91 has three different modes of engraving: V-Groove Machining, 3D Lithophane Machining, and Black and White 3D Machining. Each mode has its own advantages and applications, depending on the type of image and the material you want to use.
 
## V-Groove Machining
 
V-Groove Machining is the simplest and fastest way to engrave an image on a CNC machine. It uses a V-shaped cutter to create grooves of different widths and depths on the surface of the material. The darker areas of the image are represented by denser and deeper grooves, while the lighter areas are represented by thinner and shallower grooves. This creates a contrast and a sense of depth in the engraved image.
 
V-Groove Machining is suitable for images that have a lot of details and contrast, such as portraits, landscapes, or logos. It works best on flat and smooth materials, such as wood, plastic, or metal. You can also use different colors or finishes on the material to enhance the effect of the engraving.
 
## 3D Lithophane Machining
 
3D Lithophane Machining is a more advanced and sophisticated way to engrave an image on a CNC machine. It uses a ball-nose cutter to create a three-dimensional relief of the image on a thin and translucent material. The thickness of the material varies according to the brightness of the image. The darker areas of the image are thinner and let more light pass through, while the lighter areas are thicker and block more light. This creates a stunning effect when the engraved material is backlit.
 
3D Lithophane Machining is suitable for images that have a lot of shades and gradients, such as photographs, paintings, or illustrations. It works best on thin and translucent materials, such as acrylic, glass, or wax. You can also use different colors or filters on the light source to create different moods and atmospheres.
 
## Black and White 3D Machining
 
Black and White 3D Machining is another advanced and sophisticated way to engrave an image on a CNC machine. It uses a ball-nose cutter to create a three-dimensional map of the image on any material. The height of the material varies according to the brightness of the image. The darker areas of the image are lower and create valleys, while the lighter areas are higher and create peaks. This creates a realistic and detailed effect in the engraved image.
 
Black and White 3D Machining is suitable for images that have a lot of textures and patterns, such as animals, plants, or fabrics. It works well on any material that can be carved, such as wood, stone, or metal. You can also use different colors or finishes on the material to highlight the features of the engraving.
